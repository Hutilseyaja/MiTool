(1.4.5)





In version 1.4.5:

- to facilitate the bootloader unlocking step:
  Now, when the browser is opened, you don't need to enter login credentials again; you only need to confirm login

- suggestions or issue reports can now be directly sent to t.me/Offici5l_Group through mitool. with command : m
(this is especially useful for users who do not have a telegram account.)

- other improvements.
